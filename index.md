I am a **curious** individual, always striving to **question and solve challenging real-world problematics**. <br/>
I have developed a particular proficiency at **identifying and implementing practical solutions**, with an **Occam's razor perspective** as often as possible. <br/>
I love **explaining** how things work, and **identifying** how they can be improved. <br/>
I believe that **research** should remain closely tied to **real-world industrial challenges**, ensuring its **relevance** and **applicability**. <br/>
**Research development** should be conducted in **direct alignment** with the **final software deliverables**, enabling **solutions** that are more **tailored** to **specific market needs** and ensuring a **seamless** and **quick transition** from **innovation** to **implementation**.

*"Bernard of Chartres used to compare us to dwarfs perched on the shoulders of giants. He pointed out that we see more and farther than our predecessors, not because we have keener vision or greater height, but because we are lifted up and borne aloft on their gigantic stature."* [John of Salisbury]
